This section lists problems you might encounter while working with a Tizen TV emulator or a Samsung Smart TV.

## Common issues
 - `sdb shell` is not available
 - Cannot check the log messages
 - Cannot use debug mode

## Issues on the Smart TV device
 - Any applications loading third-party libraries (including .`so` files) are not allowed, because of Samsung Smart TV's security policy.
 - Interoperability is not allowed on Samsung Smart TV, because of security risks.
 - Test automation (such as with Appium) for the application is not available, because `sdb shell` is not available.
 - The application installed through your SDK will not be shown and is deleted when the TV device is rebooted.
