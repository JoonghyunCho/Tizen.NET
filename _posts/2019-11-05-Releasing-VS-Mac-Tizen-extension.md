I am very pleased to announce the release of the Tizen extension for Visual Studio for Mac.
There are tons of Mac users out there, and until now it has been quite tricky to use Mac machines to develop Tizen .NET applications.
<b>Visual Studio for Mac Extension for Tizen</b> was introduced at the Samsung Developer Conference 2019 held on Oct 29-30 in San Jose, CA, and is now available.

## Find an extension in your Visual Studio for Mac
The extension is provided through an `Extension Manager` in Visual Studio for Mac. Find `Visual Studio for Mac Extension for Tizen` located under `IDE extensions`.

## Installation guide
Check out <b>[this guide](https://developer.tizen.org/development/visual-studio-mac-extension-tizen)</b> for info about prerequisites and installation.
<br/><br/>
In `Prerequisites`, you see an important notice about installing Oracle Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or OpenJDK 12 to use Tizen Baseline SDK. Make sure you use the correct versions, or you may have trouble installing and using the extension.
