## Tizen .NET Portal is moving to Samsung Developers
[Tizen .NET Portal](https://samsung.github.io/Tizen.NET/) has provided lots of information about developing Tizen .NET applications.
[Posts](https://samsung.github.io/Tizen.NET/posts/) are kept updated, and the GitHub board is always open for our developers.<br/>
Now, we are happy to announce that the portal will be integrated to the [Samsung Developers](https://developer.samsung.com/) website as of January 2020.

## Samsung Developers website will be renewed
When the Samsung Developers site is renewed, Tizen .NET portal will be part of it. We will provide more information about our new home with  other Samsung developer materials. With all developer content in one place, developers don't need to wander around. Just visit Samsung Developers and find everything about developing for Samsung in one place.


## Visit Samsung Developers and Explore Tizen .NET
We'll keep you posted when the new site is open.
