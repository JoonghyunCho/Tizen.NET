Previously, in order to use custom fonts in existing Xamarin.Forms applications, you had to add the font asset in each platform project and use the `FontFamily` property to apply the fonts. This was very cumbersome, because each platform required a different syntax for referencing a font file. 

As we introduced in a [previous blog post](https://samsung.github.io/Tizen.NET/tizen%20.net/custom-fonts), using custom fonts in your Tizen .NET applications was not so simple, either.

Xamarin.Forms 4.5.0 introduced a [new uniform way](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/pull/6013) to specify custom fonts across platforms. You could define custom fonts on each platform and use them in the same way by including them as `Application Resources`, which was a feature available from [Xamarin.Forms 4.5.0 Pre Release 1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamarin.Forms/4.5.0.142-pre1). We've added Tizen support to this feature, so you don't need to write code to use custom fonts. 

> **NOTE**: This change is effective as of [Xamarin.Forms 4.5.0 Pre Release 2](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamarin.Forms/4.5.0.187-pre2) and higher.

This blog explains how to use custom embedded fonts in Xamarin.Forms Tizen applications. 

## Add the font file to your project in Visual Studio

To add fonts as resources, perform the following steps in the Visual Studio.

### 1. Create a folder to store the font files

To create a folder for storing the font files, right-click the project folder and select **Add > New Folder**.

Let's call it **Resource**.

### 2. Add a font file to your project
To add a font file to your project, right-click the **Resource** folder you just created and go to **Add > Existing item...**, or drag the file from **File Explore** (on Windows) or **Finder** (on Mac) and drop it into **Resource** folder. You can add TrueType font (`.ttf`) and OpenType font (`.otf`) files. To obtain sample font files, go [here](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/tree/master/Xamarin.Forms.Controls/Fonts).

**Note**: Be sure to add the font file with **`Build Action: Resources`**. Otherwise, the font file will not be distributed as part of your app.

After you add the font file to your project as a `Resource`, you can begin assigning the font to `VisualElement` items that have the `FontFamily` property, such as `Label`, `Entry`, and so on. Font name can be specified in XAML or in C# code. As mentioned, you no longer need to know platform-specific rules for specifying `FontFamily` attributes. Whether it's using the full path and font name separated by a hash (#) as the font name (as in Android) or it's just using the font name (as in iOS), it works well.

**Note**: that the font file name and font name may be different. To discover the font name on Windows, right-click the `.ttf` file and select **Preview**. The font name can then be determined from the preview window.

## Use your custom font in XAML


```xml
<Label Text="Custom Font 한글" FontFamily ="CuteFont-Regular" />
<Label Text="Custom Font 한글" FontFamily ="Dokdo" />
<Label Text="Custom Font 한글" FontFamily ="PTM55FT#PTMono-Regular" /> 
<Label Text="Custom Font 한글" FontFamily ="fa-regular-400.ttf#FontAwesome5Free-Regular" />
```

## Use your custom font in C#

```cs
new Label 
{
    Text = "Custom Font 한글",
    FontFamily = "CuteFont-Regular"
};

new Label 
{
    Text = "Custom Font 한글",
    FontFamily = "Dokdo"
};

new Label 
{
    Text = "Custom Font 한글",
    FontFamily = "PTM55FT#PTMono-Regular"
};

new Label 
{
    Text = "Custom Font 한글",
    FontFamily = "fa-regular-400.ttf#FontAwesome5Free-Regular"
};
```
