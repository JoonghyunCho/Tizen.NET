A splash screen appears instantly while your app launches and is quickly replaced with the app's first screen. Tizen provides an option for users to include splash screens in their applications. Splash screens can be customized based on orientation and resolution.
In this post, we take a look at how to add splash screens to your Tizen .NET applications. 

We'll use the StopWatch sample application for testing. The source code can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Samsung/Tizen-CSharp-Samples/tree/master/Wearable/XStopWatch).

## Quick Guide 

- **Step 1.** Edit the `tizen-manifest.xml` file (we recommend you use the XML editor).
  - The following code adds `<splash-screens>` into the `<ui-application>` element. The image file is located in `shared/res`.

  - For further information, refer to the **Attribute Description** section.
  
- **Step 2.** Build, package, and install the application.

- **Step 3.** Launch the application.

> The splash screen image is shown only when you launch the application by choosing from an application list (not when launching directly from Visual Studio). Also, it is shown only when the app is launched for the first time. Make sure that the splash image is not shown if the app is running in the background and reactivates (resumes).
